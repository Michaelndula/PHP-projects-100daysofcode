/*
    PHP has exceptions model similar to that of other programming languages. 
    An exception can be thrown, and caught ("catched") Within PHP.
    Code may be surrounded in a try block, to facilitate the catching of potential
    exceptions. Each try must have at least one corresponding catch or finally block.
