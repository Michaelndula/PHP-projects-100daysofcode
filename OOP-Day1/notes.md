### 1. What is the difference between OOP and SOP?
|Object-Oriented Programming | Structural Programming |
|---------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Object-Oriented Programming is a type of programming which is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures | Provides logical structure to a program where programs are divided functions |
| Bottom-up approach | Top-down approach |
| Provides data hiding | Does not provide data hiding |
| Can solve problems of any complexity | Can solve moderate problems |
| Code can be reused thereby reducing redundancy | Does not support code reusability |

### 2. What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-Oriented Programming(OOPs) is a type of programming that is based on objects rather than just functions and procedures. Individual objects are grouped into classes. OOPs implements real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism, hiding, etc into programming. It also allows binding data and code together.

### 3. Why use OOPs?
- OOPs allows clarity in programming thereby allowing simplicity in solving complex problems
- Code can be reused through inheritance thereby reducing redundancy
- Data and code are bound together by encapsulation
- OOPs allows data hiding, therefore, private data is kept confidential
- Problems can be divided into different parts making it simple to solve
- The concept of polymorphism gives flexibility to the program by allowing the entities to have multiple forms

### 4. What are the main features of OOPs?
* Inheritance
* Encapsulation
* Polymorphism
* Data Abstraction

### 5. What is an object?
An object is a real-world entity which is the basic unit of OOPs for example chair, cat, dog, etc. Different objects have different states or attributes, and behaviors.

### 6. What is a class?
A class is a prototype that consists of objects in different states and with different behaviors. It has a number of methods that are common the objects present within that class.

### 7. What is the difference between a class and a structure?
Class: User-defined blueprint from which objects are created. It consists of methods or set of instructions that are to be performed on the objects.

Structure: A structure is basically a user-defined collection of variables which are of different data types.

### 8. Can you call the base class method without creating an instance?
Yes, you can call the base class without instantiating it if:

- It is a static method
- The base class is inherited by some other subclass

### 9. What is the difference between a class and an object?
| Object | Class |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| A real-world entity which is an instance of a class | A class is basically a template or a blueprint within which objects can be created |
| An object acts like a variable of the class | Binds methods and data together into a single unit |
| An object is a physical entity | A class is a logical entity |
| Objects take memory space when they are created | A class does not take memory space when created |
| Objects can be declared as and when required | Classes are declared just once |

### 10. What is inheritance?
Inheritance is a feature of OOPs which allows classes inherit common properties from other classes. For example, if there is a class such as ‘vehicle’, other classes like ‘car’, ‘bike’, etc can inherit common properties from the vehicle class. This property helps you get rid of redundant code thereby reducing the overall size of the code.

### 11. What are the different types of inheritance?
Single inheritance
Multiple inheritance
Multilevel inheritance
Hierarchical inheritance
Hybrid inheritance
