### Static & Final Keywords in OOP

#### Static Keywords
The PHP static keyword defines static properties and static methods.
A static property/method of a class can be accessed without creating an object of that class.

A static property or method is accessed by using the scope resolution operator '::' between the class name and the property/method name.

- Note: Objects of a class cannot access static properties in the class but they can access static methods.
